# Tactical 03.07

### Grace / Chapter

Most interested in use cases rather going deeper in how systems work. A bit different from the existent proposal. Try to speak to Aragon, DAO Stack \(?\), Colony etc. Maybe we need to ask who's in DAOs right now \([Max list](https://ecosystem.daoincubator.org/wiki/dao)\).

* Grace: What should be the budget?
* Pedro: you can figure it out.
* Grace: would be of great value.
* Pedro: we can go for something more fair. 
* Grace: will submit on Mon/Tue.
* Felipe: was away a bit
* Max: looking to support

### Max / Select the solution \(similar/different, dissect, recombine\)

Pedro: like the quote that if you're not ashamed about the first prototype – you've spent too much time on it. Take baby steps. Discussing the asymmetry. We can plant the seed in other projects, mentions in dgov and other channels. Make sure people know it.

Beth: it's really good. Was helpful to learn. 

Felipe: enjoy to see how it evolves, see a lot happening. Feel free to call me up. Want to reunderstand the project.

Phil: -

Pedro: take as light homework, maybe sleep on the idea.

### Beth / Summer plans

Coming to EthBerlin? Maybe do a sprint? Find place and time.

* Pedro – tiny chance i'll be there. Aiming to work – is valuable, will try
* Max – i'm coming the web3, but not sure about EthBerlin.

Which days are you in town? 

* Maybe start a doodle?
* Good day for Max is 18
* Phil is coming
* Felipe: will be free before, my app is a giant workshop space, ready to offer that. have privacy etc. 

Maybe make a shared calendar? Can send an invite \(do share\).
