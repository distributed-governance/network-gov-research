## Glossary

**Commons** is the cultural and [natural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural) resources accessible to all members of a society, including natural materials such as air, water, and a habitable earth. These resources are held in common, not owned privately. Commons can also be understood as natural resources that groups of people \(communities, user groups\) manage for individual and collective benefit. Characteristically, this involves a variety of informal norms and values \(social practice\) employed for a governance mechanism. [\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons#cite_note-1) \[[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons)\]

**Curation Markets** is a set of protocol designs that aims to reduce information asymmetry through the use of tokenized signals. Tokens are minted as needed through a continuous token model. \[[source](https://medium.com/@simondlr/tokens-2-0-curved-token-bonding-in-curation-markets-1764a2e0bee5)\]

**Conviction voting** – ? \[[source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l73bt5h9H5zcOGr6qeRKSIAf-WOsp-fpm2ygskbEF1k/edit)\]

**TCR** \(Token Curated Registry\)​ – a registry of listings generated by token holders. \[[source](http://tokenengineering.net/tcr)\]

## Continious Token Model Case studies

### Funding \[[1](https://medium.com/thoughtchains/on-bonding-curves-as-funding-mechanisms-a0812b22cc3d), [2](https://medium.com/incentivai/bonding-curve-simulation-using-incentivai-2b2bfe0c6400)\]

However, while these curves can incentivize participation, they are not designed to actually _fund_ projects; the amount bonded is effectively locked in. I can imagine that there are many applications where funding would benefit supporters of a project by enabling development, marketing, or whatnot — so we’re left with a question: _How might we use bonding curves to fund projects?_

### Distribution of IP \[[1](https://tokeneconomy.co/token-bonding-curves-in-practice-3eb904720cb8)\]

We outline how a combination of **Non-Fungible-Tokens \(NFTs\)** and **Token Bonding Curves \(TBCs\)** can create tokenised IP and how this could result in better innovation cycles. We also determine how a potential IP curve could look, as well as the actual utility of the issued tokens. This is rounded off by a practical example of the proposed mechanism in the pharmaceutical industry.

### Utility token \[[1](https://medium.com/collabs-io/can-we-save-the-utility-token-55ef639370cf)\]

We argue that in spite of the bad maths and hangover from the hubris that has gone before, there is merit to the idea of the utility token and that we can find models that better reflect their true value, discourage speculation, and result in an asset that can be programmed to incentivise desirable dynamics within a community built around open source software.

### Trade Popularity & Memes \[[1](https://medium.com/@simondlr/introducing-curation-markets-trade-popularity-of-memes-information-with-code-70bf6fed9881)\]

Each topic/meme/idea/goal has an associated token of value that is used to curate information inside it.

### Futarchy \[[1](https://ethresear.ch/t/futarchy-with-bonding-curve-tokens/3449)\]

A [bonding curve token 8](https://medium.com/@justingoro/token-bonding-curves-explained-7a9332198e0e) has a built in price-finding mechanism as well as a reserve pool of funds. This can be used to create a relatively simple and self-contained futarchy mechanism. 

### Art

### Liberal Radicalism \[[1](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3243656)\]

### Budgeting Boxes \[[1](https://colony.io/budgetbox.pdf?mc_cid=2887bf737e&mc_eid=c707b1c3e7)\]
