# Strategy

## Purpose

Develop products for the network governance

## Stakeholders

Network is a type of organization focused on connecting members for collaboration and opportunities exchange.

1. Network Foundations \(Ethereum Foundation, Internet Foundation, Decentralized Identity Foundation\)
2. Platform Cooperatives \(electricity, data, hacktivists, DEX etc mostly digital\)
3. Public Communities \(Neighborhood, Fan projects etc\)
4. Consortia and Associations \([Ethereum Enterprise Alliance](https://entethalliance.org/)**,** Libra Network\)

## Goals

### Improve the efficiency of Network Foundations

* [Collect the info on the current network governance](https://mapping.daolandscape.today/network-governance/blockchain-summary)
  * Update the Governance family tree: Ethereum, MakerDAO, Cardano, Grin, Bitcoin, Polkdadot, Cosmos, Decred, MolochDAO  governance case studies. Development on existent governance case studies though deeper analytics and interviews with network stakeholders.
  * Glossary with words like commons, governance, egalitarian, plutocracy etc.
* Research: Increase the probability and speed of consensus on protocol changes
  * Identifying the tensions
  * Creating proposals
  * Collecting the signals on the proposals
  * Presenting
* Research: Funding public goods
* Partner with [ISSDG](https://issdg.org/) 

### Improve the efficiency of Platform Cooperatives

* Build the list of current coops
  * dOrg
  * [Stocksy United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stocksy_United)
  * [Midata](https://www.midata.coop/)
  * 4IRE
  * Translation Coop
* Drive more activity, retention and loyalty from customers, business partners, network/marketplace users via distributing future value
* Make community interviews with selected governance TA
* Connect partners to help \(+dgov, Martin, giveth labs\)
* Decreasing the governance costs \(0%\)
* Improve OrgXP
* How to make collaborative strategies
* Partner with Nathan Schneider / [MEDLabBoulder](https://twitter.com/MEDLabBoulder)

### Improve the efficiency of Public Communities

* Soft governance practices in blockchain organizations through interviews with HR/Facilitators and teams. Plus existent tools review like loomio or zoom rooms.
* Fund public goods
  * Stake to come to network + tax
  * Networks on subscription \(Buy-in or work-in\)
* Increasing the amount and quality of interactions in the community

### Increase Team Capacity

* Regular Open workshops/groups in the ecosystem and community
  * Create Partnerships work \(monthly working group call or else for more efficient research\) \#Governance \(advisors, experts\) Crash test / Ideation
* Collect / Monthly review grant programs, hackathons, [incubators / accelerators](https://wiki.4irelabs.com/docs/research/blockchain-accelerators-and-incubators)
* \(+Help scholars, ask them to help us with wiki etc\)

#### Use Grants
