# Tactical \#2

## Check-in

* Grace: want to help writing, organizing, learn how this process works
* Max: lots of great work done, big team wow
* Phoebe: i’m in NZ, 11pm, tired. Read the proposal, am 1 step behind. Love project based learning. If we do together – we can produce knowledge for others
* Ela: based in Berlin, work in Supermarkt, worked with Andreas on RChain Coop, want to see how i can help and support
* Pedro: like the group growing, as mentioned it started around Oct with ATF. We decided then we need that mapping. To understand how accountability is done. Since then I’ve been carrying this desire, use neck test to look around. Really content we’re finally here together with our visions and objections. Am researcher on multiple entities, Rhizom, part or ECSA, Genesis, DAO Incubator, Blockchain research network
* Andreas: glad we’re expanding. Like to make a proposal to see how it’s working. In particular, i’ve done a mapping tool already \(50 tools from all around the world\), and have 22-30 other orgs not on the map. Have prepared a sheet, it’s structured in a 4 main groups \(to understand the outcomes\). Other big thing is visualization. Plus map of stakeholders. Lastly the report

## Max / Setup regular biweekly call

Setup every 2 weeks

## Pedro / Roadmap

* Clear next steps and deadlines \(trello maybe?\)
* Preliminary Research
  * [State of the DAO until march 29 with Daniel](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Mck_XZiHGlfYQw9MczZ8blarAlBfEJwOpNh2w2imsU/edit) \(Pedro, Grace\)
  * [Proposals for funds on Alchemy regarding GenDAO internal proposals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iw7BA5aIsjuHNxi9DeZyHtatLNPw5tYYrkfNARQmVK0/edit) \(Pedro, Phoebe, Grace, Andreas\)
* Report
  * [Submit abstract here until april 2nd; needs a phd student; Theo from The Incubator can help](https://sites.google.com/view/oui2019/); \(please take a look, let’s further discuss\)
* Visualization
  * [have an email draft for envisioning; need approval for the platform \(merely as candidate\) and for the email message itself](https://www.envisioning.io/); [example](https://viz.envisioning.io/wgs-citizenship/)

Andreas: Why preliminary. Is it different

Pedro: it’s actionable steps, e.g. preliminary mapping.

Grace: we can run step 1 and 2 simultaneously.

Phoebe: same

Grace: there’s limited amount in the Genesis, also building trust is better in smaller steps

Pedro: @preliminary – test tun of our work together

Ela: are we already in agreement of the outcome? Is it just an overview or a specific thesis to underline?

Grace: it’s in the 2nd sheet of Pedros. We identified 1\) knowledge for to-be-DAOs \(e.g. best practices on things like proposal making\), 2\) interoperability gaps.

Decision: no objections

Pedro: time sensitive DAO incubator with Dani

Phoebe: how that helps?

Pedro: the info he’ll put on slides will be used by us

Grace: Dani in NYC? Do we want him here

Pedro: \(Berlin usually\) but couldn’t reach this one

Phoebe: can we do async?

Pedro: Yeap, who want to do that this week \(Grace\) – will continue async.

Pedro: Who’s interested in Genesis Alpha DAO? \(Grace, Andreas, Phoebe\)

## Max / Create Coordinator \(editor\) role

Purpose: coordinate to create consistency in the final report, avoid overlapping or underrepresentation of some topics or thoughts.

Accountabilities:

* Review/Request edits of materials by authors
* Managing the Scope of the report
* Assignments \(matching\) of chapter/author

Reactions:

Pedro: can be dynamic role

Phoebe: that’s fine while we know that person

Andreas: how we work is handy, Max is doing some, when we’re talking about the content if everybody has an option to contribute. Like the proposal.

Grace: important to have this role, we don’t want to end up in the position when nothing happens

Ela: agree

No objection – create.

## Max / If passes - Coordinator \(editor\) assignment

Max: nominate Pedro

Phoebe: nominate Max

Grace: nominate Andreas

Ela: how important is connection to Genesis.

Grace: just need somebody organized

Max: i can do, if Pedro can’t do it

Andreas: how important is good english knowledge.

Andreas: Phoebe or Ela – what it be good to have a fresh look?

Decision: Pedro

## Closing round

* Ela: Thanks, eager to look deeper in the research
* Phoebe: resonate with Ela, like the energy and pace. Have a question – where to make edits to the proposal, to get more context \(Grace and Pedro\). To do better: appreciated a rough agenda and links
* Andreas: really focusing on the content, with our meeting we’re moving good, without tools. Like the process
* Grace: excited to have next steps, like that everybody likes each other, another dimension to the work
* Pedro: agree it’s critical to have docs/agenda. Second Grace for warm dynamics. Assuming this role would like to have an agreement on how to coordinate actionables. E.g. Trello, with all steps, actions, decisions. Github projects – is my choice, as there could be docs, integrations etc. If there would.
* Max:
